# 0x1B. C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O (Test Suite)

## 📚 Project Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive test suite for the **0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O** project in the ALX Software Engineering program.  
It is designed to validate the correctness, efficiency, and stability of various sorting algorithm implementations.

## 🧪 Purpose of the Tests

The purpose of these test files is to:

- Verify that each sorting algorithm sorts arrays correctly.
- Check that each function adheres to the required time and space complexities.
- Ensure proper behavior for edge cases (e.g., empty arrays, arrays with one element, duplicate values).
- Compare output against expected results using automated or manual validation.
