# 📊 0x1B. C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O

## 📌 Description

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Curriculum**. It introduces the concept of **sorting algorithms**, with a strong focus on their **performance analysis** using **Big O notation**. You will implement a range of comparison and non-comparison-based sorting techniques, understand their mechanics, and analyze the **trade-offs** between time complexity, space usage, and algorithmic stability.

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the purpose and fundamentals of **sorting algorithms**.
- Understand and apply the **Big O notation** to assess algorithm performance.
- Implement and differentiate between various sorting methods (comparison vs. non-comparison).
- Analyze **best**, **average**, and **worst-case complexities**.
- Discuss **stability** and its impact in practical applications.
- Use **linked lists**, **arrays**, and **custom data structures** in sorting contexts.
